# Mouse Game

## Concept
Mouse Game was based around the mouse PNG for the character. To keep up with the forest theme,
            leaves were chosen as the collectible objects, and mushrooms were added as an obstacle for the user to
            avoid. Color tracking was chosen over the other techniques available since it made the game simple to play
            (no markers needed).

## Instructions
Mouse Game uses color tracking and the user's webcam to create an interactive minigame. To start, use your computer mouse or mousepad to click on a color on the canvas, and the character will then follow that color. Collect as many leaves as you can. Green sprouts give you one point and orange leaves give you five points. Make sure to avoid the mushroomsâ€”they will decrease your score by five points!
